## User Story

AS A marketing agency <br>
I WANT a code base that follows accessibility standards <br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines <br>

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards <br>
WHEN I view the source code <br>
THEN I find seminatic HTML elements <br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements <br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning <br>
WHEN I view the image elements <br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes <br>
WHEN I  view the heading attributes <br>
THEN they fall in sequential order <br>
WHEN I view the title element <br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title <br>

### GitLab and GitHub

I cloned the repository of the starter code from the https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram. <br>
I have created a local repository and remote repository under the name "accessibility-standards-met". <br>
I have practiced and used new git commands to push commits from my local repository to my remote repository.

### HTML Commits

I have changed the title of the website from "website" to "Horiseon Social Solution Services for Businesses". <br>
I have replaced "div" with other sementic HTML elements such as "header", "section" and "footer" in the appropriate places. <br>
I have deleted "div" for the unordered list and give the unordered list a certain class. <br>
I have added "id" for the unordered list of items to navigate the user to the right section of the webpage <br>
I have changed some of the classes' names such that they repeat for certain sections as they all have the same styling given in CSS. <br>
I have noticed that "h3" is only used once so they all have the same styling given in CSS without using a class element. <br>
I have provided "alt" for each image."

### CSS Commits

I have changed the type and class selectors such that it compensates for the deleted "div" in HTML. <br>
I have consolidated the CSS by noticing the same patterns that occurs for certain classes' names. <br>
I have commented each section of CSS style to say what their properties are.
